memoir is intended to be a minimal cli diary.

Usage:
Run memoir by typing 'm' into a terminal.
Type out your memoir, and it will write the entry to '~/.memoir/today' and exit as soon as 
an empty line is encountered.
If the first line is empty, it wont write the entry.
You can also send a SIGINT to exit the program without side effects.
Every time a new note is added on a different day, the current today file gets renamed to 
"~/.memoir/memoir-%Y-%m-%d" and a new today file is created.

Alternatively, you can run 'm' with any number of arguments.
Once you run 'm' with the arguments, it will automatically add a one line entry to 
'~/.memoir/today'.

Format of entries:
date
    entry
Entries are separated by a line of dashes.

Dependencies:
python3


My First Fork =]
I has been using memoir for a little while, but I wanted it to have its own directory and 
to split entries up by date and easily get to today's entries.
